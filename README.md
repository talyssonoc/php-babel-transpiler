# PHP Babel Transpiler

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/talyssonoc/php-babel-transpiler.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/talyssonoc/php-babel-transpiler)

Transform JavaScript with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) from PHP.

## Installation

### V8Js dependency

It's important to know that `php-babel-transpiler` has a dependency of the [v8js](https://pecl.php.net/package/v8js) PHP extension.

You can see how to install it here: [how to install V8Js](https://github.com/talyssonoc/react-laravel/blob/master/install_v8js.md).

### Composer

```sh
  php composer.phar require talyssonoc/php-babel-transpiler
```

Since changes in composer , now impossible to run scripts from package, so you need to add this section in your ROOT composer.json:

```sh
"scripts": {
    "post-install-cmd":"\"vendor/talyssonoc/php-babel-transpiler/node_modules/.bin/browserify\" \"vendor/talyssonoc/php-babel-transpiler/src/executor.js\" > vendor/talyssonoc/php-babel-transpiler/assets/executor.bundle.js",
    "post-update-cmd":"\"vendor/talyssonoc/php-babel-transpiler/node_modules/.bin/browserify\" \"vendor/talyssonoc/php-babel-transpiler/src/executor.js\" > vendor/talyssonoc/php-babel-transpiler/assets/executor.bundle.js"
}
```
to build executor bundle.

## Usage

```php
  $transpiledCode = Babel\Transpiler::transform('class MyClass {  }');
  $otherTranspiledCode = Babel\Transpiler::transformFile('/my/Class.js', [ 'blacklist' => [ 'useStrict' ] ]);
```
